The lastIndexOf() method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array,
or -1 if it is not present. The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex.

If the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array, the whole array will be searched.
If negative, it is taken as the offset from the end of the array.
If the calculated index is less than 0, -1 is returned, i.e. the array will not be searched.
The last index of the element in the array; -1 if not found.
